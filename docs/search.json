    "text": "Nanodrop 260/280\nThe standard measures of nucleic acid purity from Nanodrop measurements are the 260/280 and 260/230 absorption ratios. The standard advice is that, for a pure RNA sample, 260/280 should be around 2.0, while pure DNA should be around 1.8. Lower ratios are typically indicative of contamination with protein, or some specific contaminants such as phenol.\nThe 260/280 ratios measured for the DNase-treated samples are as follows:\n\nCodeg_260_280 &lt;- ggplot(data) +\n  geom_rect(ymin = 1.8, ymax = 2.2, xmin = 0, xmax = Inf, fill = \"black\", alpha = 0.02) +\n  geom_rect(ymin = 1.9, ymax = 2.1, xmin = 0, xmax = Inf, fill = \"black\", alpha = 0.02) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=kit, y=nanodrop_rna_260_280), shape = 16) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.8, 2.3), breaks = seq(0,5,0.2),\n                     name = \"Absorption ratio (260nm/280nm)\") +\n  theme_base + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, vjust = 1, angle = 45),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\")\ng_260_280\n\n\n\nFigure 5: 260/280 ratios for DNase-treated samples.\n\n\n\nNone of the kits returned 260/280 ratios at the expected level for pure RNA, though most were not drastically low. Several returned ratios close to (though below) 1.8, which might be indicative of significant residual DNA in the sample; it’s hard to distinguish between this and protein contamination without doing DNA Qubit measurements on the DNase-treated samples. Free dNTP nucleotides produced by the DNase treatment still absorb at DNA-like ratios, so DNA-like readings may not be indicative of poor quality here.\nAs with yield, the Qiagen AllPrep PowerViral kit does notably worse than the other kits."

    "text": "Nanodrop 260/230\nThe 260/230 absorption ratio gives a useful indicator of the presence of various contaminants, including phenol, carbohydrates, guanidine, and various salts. The standard advice is that a pure sample should have a 260/230 of around 2.0-2.2, with lower ratios indicating contamination. Readings for our DNase-treated samples are as follows:\n\nCodeg_260_230 &lt;- ggplot(data) +\n  geom_rect(ymin = 1.9, ymax = 2.3, xmin = 0, xmax = Inf, fill = \"black\", alpha = 0.02) +\n  geom_rect(ymin = 2.0, ymax = 2.2, xmin = 0, xmax = Inf, fill = \"black\", alpha = 0.02) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=kit, y=nanodrop_rna_260_230), shape = 16) +\n  scale_y_continuous(#limits = c(0.8, 2.3),\n                     breaks = seq(0,5,0.2),\n                     name = \"Absorption ratio (260nm/230nm)\") +\n  theme_base + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, vjust = 1, angle = 45),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\")\ng_260_230\n\n\n\nFigure 6: 260/230 ratios for DNase-treated samples.\n\n\n\nAs we can see, many kits have significantly lower 260/230 ratios than the recommended range, indicating contamination – most likely with guanidinium salts involved in nucleic acid extraction. Combined with the 260/280 results above, this suggests that many kits would benefit from an additional cleanup step. As with other metrics, the Qiagen AllPrep PowerViral kit comes out looking worst.\nTwo kits (NucleoSpin Virus and Zymo quick-RNA) have at least one replicate with significantly higher 260/230 ratios than the recommended values. It’s not very clear what could cause this, but one resource I found suggested misblanking as the likely culprit. I’d recommend repeating the nanodrop measurements for these samples to see if the pattern persists."
